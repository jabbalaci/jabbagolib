JabbaGoLib
==========

Some common stuff to facilitate work with Go. I started to
learn Go after Python and I miss some things in Go that I
try to implement here.

Examples
--------

* reverse a string
* shuffle a slice of integers
* read easily from stdin
* etc.

Usage
-----

    import (
        "github.com/jabbalaci/jabbagolib/???"
    )
